# Desktop Administrator

The Administrator is a Java desktop application for managing an OIE server. It builds channels, monitors traffic, manages users, and edits server settings.

::: info
As of 4.6.0 this is no longer the only graphical option. The [Web Administrator](./web_administrator.md) does the same job in a browser, and both can be pointed at the same engine at the same time.
:::

Starting the client and logging in are covered in [Accessing the Administrator](./accessing_the_administrator.md). It connects over HTTPS on port `8443` by default, and a status bar along the bottom of the window shows the server URL, the logged-in user, and the server time with its timezone.

## The left menu

The left side of the window is a context-sensitive menu.

| View | What it is |
|---|---|
| **Dashboard** | The first screen after logging in. Deployed channels with their state, message counts, and connection activity. Start, stop, pause, and undeploy from here, and open the [Message Browser](./dashboard_and_monitoring.md#message-browser) for a channel with **View Messages**. See [Dashboard and Monitoring](./dashboard_and_monitoring.md) |
| **Channels** | Every channel configured on the server. Create, delete, import, export, clone, enable, disable, and deploy. Channels can be grouped, and filtered by name or tag |
| **Users** | Accounts that can reach the server through either administrator, the CLI, or the REST API. See [User Management](./user_management.md) |
| **Settings** | Server-wide configuration, covered [below](#settings) |
| **Alerts** | Configured alerts with their status and how often each has fired. See [Alerts and Notifications](./alerts_and_notifications.md) |
| **Events** | A searchable log of user actions and system events, filterable by date, severity, user, and outcome, exportable to CSV. See [the Event Browser](./dashboard_and_monitoring.md#event-browser) |
| **Extensions** | Installed plugins and connectors with their status, author, and version, and where you enable or disable them. See the [Plugin Guide](./plugins.md) |

## Channel Editor

Opening a channel from the Channels view gives you a tabbed workspace:

| Tab | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **Summary** | Name, description, data types, initial state, storage and pruning settings, tags, dependencies, and custom metadata columns |
| **Source** | The source connector and its settings |
| **Destinations** | One or more destination connectors, each with its own filter and transformer |
| **Scripts** | Channel-level Deploy, Undeploy, Preprocessor, and Postprocessor scripts |

Within Source and Destinations you can open two editors:

- **Filter Editor**, for rules (Rule Builder, JavaScript, External Script, [Iterator](./glossary.md#iterator)) joined by AND/OR. Matching messages are accepted, others rejected.
- **Transformer Editor**, for a sequence of steps ([Mapper](./glossary.md#mapper), [Message Builder](./glossary.md#message-builder), JavaScript, External Script, XSLT Step, Iterator, [Destination Set Filter](./glossary.md#destination-set)). Dragging a field between the inbound and outbound message trees generates a mapping step.

A connector's filter and transformer are compiled into one script sharing one scope, which is why a value set in the filter is still there in the transformer. See [Filters and Transformers](./filters_and_transformers.md).

## Settings

The tabs cover server-wide options:

| Tab | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **Server** | Environment name and server name, both of which appear in the title bar, plus usage statistics preference, default queue buffer size, default metadata columns, and SMTP configuration |
| **Administrator** | UI preferences such as dashboard refresh interval and confirmation dialog behavior |
| **Tags** | Create and manage channel tags |
| **Configuration Map** | Key-value pairs readable from channel scripts at runtime |
| **Database Tasks** | Pending and completed database migration tasks |
| **Resources** | Custom class-path library resources available to channels |
| **Data Pruner** | Global settings for automatic message pruning |

A plugin that ships a settings panel adds its own tab here, named for the plugin.

## Other

Below the view buttons, a fixed section of the left menu is available from every view:

| Task | Description |
|---|---|
| **Notifications** | OIE release announcements from the project's GitHub repository. Unread items show a count badge |
| **View User API** | Opens the User API (Javadoc) in your browser |
| **View Client API** | Opens the REST API documentation in your browser |
| **Visit homepage** | Opens the OIE project repository |
| **Report Issue** | Opens the project's issue tracker |
| **Help** | Opens the OIE GitHub discussions |
| **About** | Version, build date, server ID, Java version, and third-party acknowledgements |
| **Logout** | Ends the session and returns to the login screen |

## Working with tables

Most screens present data in tables that behave the same way:

- Drag a column header to move it; adjacent columns shift.
- Right-click the header row to show or hide columns, or use the table control icon at its top right.
- Click a header to sort ascending, again for descending. Not every table sorts.
- Click the plus or minus beside a row to expand or collapse it, or right-click the header for Expand All and Collapse All.
- Shift-click for a contiguous range of rows, Ctrl-click (Cmd on macOS) for individual ones.
- Press Delete to remove a selected row, where the table allows it.
