# Migrating from Mirth Connect on macOS

**This page is not written yet.** Contributions welcome, see [Contributing](./contributing.md).

Read [Migrating from Mirth Connect](./migrating_from_mirth_connect.md) for the part that does
not change with the platform: what OIE keeps from Mirth, what migrates, how extensions are
checked, what the keystore holds, and the backups to take first.

Throughout this page Mirth Connect is installed at `/Applications/Mirth Connect` and OIE at `/Applications/OpenIntegrationEngine`. The OIE path is the documented default, see [Installation](./installation.md). Substitute your own.

[Migrating on Linux](./migrating_linux.md) is the template. The eleven steps are the same.
Three of them need macOS equivalents, against the launchd daemon `com.oie.oieservice` defined
in `/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.oie.oieservice.plist`:

- **Step 4**, the account the daemon runs as, set in the plist rather than a systemd drop-in.
- **Steps 5, 7, 10 and 11**, `launchctl` in place of `systemctl` for starting, stopping and
  unloading the daemon, and confirming the process is gone.
- **Step 8**, copying the application data, and the `chown` that has to follow it.

See [Server Process Management](./server_process_management.md) for how the daemon is managed
on macOS.

## What this touches

Everything the procedure edits or copies, and the step that does it. See
[Installation](./installation.md) for the full directory listing.
